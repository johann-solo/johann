This is such a cliché question. But there is a reason for that. People are always jumping into the field and there is a level of trepidation attached. Not to mention the potential expense as this is not always the cheapest hobby/profession to enter. What brand to chose? What lens to choose? Do I need to learn to use Photoshop? Tripods? Lots of questions. Thankfully I there is a lot out free info out there, especially via YouTube. Here are my two cents.

If you aren't sure what you are going to start shooting, or whether or not this is going to be a serious (or not so serious) hobby or even your new career, it probably means you don't want to invest too heavily. You probably just want to dip your toes in to see first. I'm a Canon shooter but at this stage most pro or semi-pro brands will give you roughly the same results – each with its own strengths and weakness. What you want to do at this stage is to gather experience, learning composition, editing and finding your own style. These all take time.

I started on a *Rebel T6*, a fairly decent cropped sensor camera (more on this in another post maybe). I took it on vacation and even started my first food shoots with it. But it soon became apparent what its limitations were. Crop sensors while relatively inexpensive really struggle with low light. Not yet having a great lighting setup as well as not understanding how light works in photography some results were poor. I was a bit discouraged as I knew I couldn't afford all the enviable L lenses. Then I got some advice that I wish I got before my purchase.

Get a **Canon 5D Mark 1** also known now as the Canon 5D Classic. At the time this was a top of the line camera, in 2005. Now that may seem a long time in tech circles, and it is. The camera shows its age in many ways. For one it doesn't shoot video(!). It lacks an articulating (flip-out) screen, which isn't touch enabled. It uses old CF cards, no wifi, no GPS, "why are we using this again?" The reason is this ***the pictures it produces are awesome***. To quote a wiley space pirate – "she may not look like much, but she got it where it counts".

First off this thing is a full frame camera. There are a tonne of benefits of this but the most immediate advantage is that it's great in low light. I was amazed that it blew away my newer T6 in this respect.
