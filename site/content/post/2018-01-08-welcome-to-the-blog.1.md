I am not a blogger. I mean I like the concept of blogging but I never seemed disciplined enough to chronicle things. Note taking and the like is usually a chore for me. Maybe I never felt like I had anything worthwhile to write about or maybe I don't like to get too personal. Not sure. But here I am.  

Photography is something I kind of fell into. I mean I always loved looking at pictures but never really thought of creating them before. Maybe I'll get into the reasons for starting my photography journey in a future post. This site is really the sister site to my wife's site [Olive & Mango](https://www.oliveandmango.com/). Here I will be focusing more on the photography aspect of the blog and my thoughts and goals for my photography in general.  

For those who read and support, I give a hearty **"Thank You"** in advance. Enjoy the blog!

Johann
