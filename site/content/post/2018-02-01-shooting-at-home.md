Many people just love working from home. There seem to be so many advantages – no commute time, control over your work environment, no one takes your food in the fridge and the ability to work in your pyjamas. Of course, there are some draw backs  such as a blurring of work life and home life. However, using your home as a photography studio also brings some unique challenges – complete chaos.  

> The downside it that everything must be completely rearranged

We haven't reached the point where we can have our own studio – or even a separate room to do our shoots. So our living room often becomes our studio. Now at this moment we live in a fairly modest one bedroom apartment. The living room blends into the kitchen area. The plus side is that it means the food doesn't have a long travel to get setup for our blog shoots. The downside it that everything must be completely rearranged. Often props and food are placed in unusual places as the shoots unfold.

Aside from the usual dishes and cooking cleanup that ensues from every production, we often found ourselves in a whirlwind of furniture and props after each shoot. What was our solution? We had to get a system in place. A simple thing we did was to to have a set pattern to rearrange the furniture into. And it sounds obvious, but we had to make sure that it was always easy to manoeuvre around the set without having to trip over anything. For my own sanity, I found that as soon as we were done with a prop or a backdrop, I had to immediately put it away to reduce clutter. It removed the anxiety and stress during the shoot and gave me a measure of peace of mind and patience.  

This was just a quick thought on working from home. Do you shoot from home? What challenges do you face? And what are you doing to cope/overcome them?
